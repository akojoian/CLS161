## Reading Reflection 2

Reading: The Cambridge Companion to Edward Gibbon or Gibbon's Decline and Fall.

While describing Marcus, Commodus’ father, Gibbon deems it appropriate and perhaps necessary to include that Marcus earnestly requested that the senate declare his wife, Faustina, “a goddess” (The Decline and Fall, p. 84).  The author further details how Faustina was represented in temples and was portrayed with the characteristics of the Roman goddesses, Juno, Venus, and Ceres.  Moreover, it was expected and ordered that on their wedding day, Roman youths would respect the goddess by paying “their vows before the altar of their chaste patroness” (The Decline and Fall, p. 84).  
It should be noted that this is not the first time in Roman history that leaders associated themselves with the divine.  While taking a Roman History course as an undergraduate, we examined how Roman leaders portrayed themselves as deities as a way of maintaining control.  During this course, I wrote a paper about how Augustus Caesar depicted himself as divine to gain not only popularity, but also political support through this propaganda.  If the Roman citizens defied the will of their divine leader, there could be extreme consequences.  
While Gibbon positively portrays Marcus and Faustina, he counters their goodness by comparing them to their son, Commodus.  Nonetheless, Marcus chose Commodus to be his successor, “admitting [him] … to a full participation of the Imperial power” (The Decline and Fall, p. 84) instead of selecting someone from the republic (The Decline and Fall, p. 84).  Perhaps Marcus, understanding the temperament and the “monstrous vices” (The Decline and Fall, p. 84) of his son, attempted to protect Commodus’ command by deifying his mother.  If the people believed that Commodus was indeed the son of a goddess, they would be less likely to overthrow him.  In the Iliad, Achilles, the son of the sea nymph, Thetis, was feared by both the Greeks and Trojans alike.  It is therefore possible to consider that Marcus was attempting to influence the people and secure his son’s leadership by claiming divine lineage.
