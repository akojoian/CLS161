## Reading Reflection 1

Reading: Gardiner and Musto: Introduction to the Digital Humanities and The Organization of Humanities Research. 

Venn diagrams are often very helpful in math problems, especially in probability.  These diagrams define sets by creating visual representations of the intersection, the complement, and the disjoint union of these sets.  While Venn diagrams can overlap forming an intersection of two groups, there can also be elements within one set that are not contained in the other.   

Considering the article written by Gardiner and Musto entitled “Introduction to the Digital Humanities,” one of the central topics addressed was, “is the digital hurting the humanities by drawing scholars away from the traditional work of humanists and turning them into number crunchers or bell-and-whistle builders?” (Gardiner and Musto, p.5).  While some people would consider this to be a valid concern, there are others that would argue that the “marriage” (Gardiner and Musto, p.1) between digital and humanities can intersect while each can be deployed independently for separate responsibilities.  As mentioned in that article, the convergence of digital and humanities which was introduced in 1949 by Roberto Busa “opened new research methods” (Gardiner and Musto, p. 3) by supporting humanist scholars in working “more quickly and efficiently” (Gardiner and Musto, p. 5).  
  
While it is a useful tool which can enhance the humanities, digital technology should never replace the work of humanists.  The study of “humanitas,” as described by Aulus Gellius which encompasses “learning and instruction in good or liberal arts,” is complete without the digital component (Gardiner and Musto, p. 8).  Gardiner and Musto, in their article entitled “The Organization of Humanities Research” describe the differences between humanities, social sciences, and physical sciences by addressing how each interprets and “represents evidence” (Gardiner and Musto, p. 15).  The common goal of humanists is to “interpret the evidence of human lives, thoughts and actions” (Gardiner and Musto, p. 9), while social and physical scientists analyze data through mathematics such as statistics, and “other quantitative means” (Gardiner and Musto, p. 15).  Even Thomas Jefferson, who was an advocate for the new sciences of his time, cherished the liberal arts.  (In fact, he designed the core curriculum at the University of Virginia so that it encompassed both classics and science (Gardiner and Musto, p. 11)).  While the different disciplines can intersect like Venn diagrams, and enhance the elements within the other fields, they are also very much individual entities.
